# My First Coding Assignment #
![Charlie Kelly from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia saying we would all rather be home playing with cats](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/030/096/2b207777d6c4ed26c35d2a62fe122711.jpg)
## About Me ##
My name is Allie and I am currently seeking my Master's in Mass Communication in public relations. I am the proud mom to a sweet chunky black cat named Secret and a wild Australian Cattle Dog named Jasper. 
## Past Coding Experience ##
I have zero past coding experience, bar some basic HTML coding of my Tumblr profile over a decade ago. Coding runs in my family, as my dad is a computer programmer and my brother is a software engineer, but somehow all of those "computer genes" completely skipped me.
## Career Goals ##
1. Complete my Master's in public relations.
2. Become a Director of Public Relations or Director of Communications.
3. Utilize my Spanish education more in my positions to help bridge gaps and better reach current or potential target audiences.
